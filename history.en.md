# History

 - master/HEAD
   * Modified: No behavior is changed but some codes are just removed. AMO Editors always banned new releases, because an included library had codes with "evalInSandbox()" for backward compatibility - even if it is NEVER called on this addon.
   * Modified: Update codes around [session store API](http://dutherenverseauborddelatable.wordpress.com/2013/05/23/add-on-breakage-continued-list-of-add-ons-that-will-probably-be-affected/).
 - 0.1.2013040601
