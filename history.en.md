# History

 - master/HEAD
   * Modified: No behavior is changed but some codes are just removed. AMO Editors always banned new releases, because an included library had codes with "evalInSandbox()" for backward compatibility - even if it is NEVER called on this addon.
 - 0.1.2013040601
   * Fixed: Restore suspended tab automatically when it is reloaded.
 - 0.1.2012122901
   * Released.
